## Client Profile

| | |
|---|---|
| **Firm** | Meridian Commercial Realty |

## The Challenge

Meridian Commercial Realty specializes in office and retail leasing in South Florida's competitive market. Their small legal team was overwhelmed by the volume and complexity of commercial lease reviews.

### Pain Points

- **Complex Documents**: Commercial leases averaging 80-120 pages each
- **Time Pressure**: Deals lost to competitors with faster turnaround
- **Lease Variations**: Each landlord had different templates and terms
- **Hidden Clauses**: Brokers missed costly provisions buried in dense text
- **Liability Exposure**: Clients blamed Meridian when unfavorable terms surfaced later

> *"We were losing deals because we couldn't turn around lease reviews fast enough. But if we rushed, we missed things that cost our clients—and our reputation—dearly."*
> 
> — **David Reyes**, Managing Broker

## The Solution

Meridian implemented **LegalMind Business Plan** for their legal team and trained brokers to run initial analyses before attorney review.

### Two-Tier Review Process

**Tier 1: Broker Pre-Review (5 minutes)**
- Broker uploads lease to LegalMind
- AI extracts key terms: rent, CAM, options, restrictions
- Broker reviews summary with client

**Tier 2: Attorney Deep Dive (30 minutes)**
- Attorney reviews AI-flagged risks
- Focuses on: liability caps, default provisions, exclusivity clauses
- Signs off or negotiates amendments
