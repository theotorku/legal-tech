## The Challenge

Peterson & Associates, a respected mid-size law firm specializing in corporate transactions, was struggling with an increasingly common problem: **contract review bottlenecks**.

### Pain Points

- **Time-Intensive Reviews**: Junior associates spent 4-6 hours reviewing each commercial contract for risks and key terms
- **Inconsistent Analysis**: Different attorneys flagged different issues, leading to inconsistent client deliverables
- **Missed Deadlines**: During peak M&A periods, the firm struggled to meet client timelines
- **Associate Burnout**: Repetitive contract review was leading to high turnover among junior staff
- **Scaling Issues**: The firm was turning away new business due to capacity constraints

> *"We were drowning in contracts. Our associates were working 80-hour weeks just to keep up with due diligence reviews, and we still couldn't take on new clients."*
> 
> — **Sarah Peterson**, Managing Partner
