## The Challenge

Barrett & Morrison was retained to represent a Fortune 1000 company in a $47 million breach of contract dispute. The case hinged on analyzing 12 years of vendor agreements—over 2,400 contracts.

### The Stakes

- **$47 million** in claimed damages
- **2,400+ contracts** requiring analysis
- **90-day discovery deadline**
- **Client's reputation** on the line

### Traditional Approach Would Have Required

- 6 contract attorneys working full-time for 3 months
- Estimated cost: $480,000 in document review alone
- High risk of human error across 2,400 documents
- No guarantee of meeting the deadline

> *"We were looking at half a million dollars just for document review, and even then, I wasn't confident we'd find every smoking gun in 2,400 contracts. We needed a different approach."*
> 
> — **Thomas Barrett**, Senior Partner

## The Solution

Barrett & Morrison used **LegalMind Enterprise** with batch processing to analyze the entire contract corpus in days, not months.

### The Approach

| Phase | Timeline | Activity |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Batch Upload** | Day 1-2 | 2,400 contracts uploaded via API |
| **AI Analysis** | Day 3-5 | Full analysis of all documents |
| **Risk Flagging** | Day 6-7 | Identified 847 contracts with relevant provisions |
| **Deep Review** | Week 2-4 | Attorneys focused only on flagged contracts |
| **Evidence Compilation** | Week 5-6 | Built case strategy from findings |

### What LegalMind Found

The AI analysis automatically identified:

- **127 contracts** with modified liability provisions
- **43 contracts** with unusual termination clauses
- **18 contracts** with verbal amendment references
- **3 contracts** with clear breach indicators (smoking guns)

## The Results

### Document Review Comparison

| Metric | Traditional | With LegalMind | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Time to complete review | 90 days | 6 weeks | **53% faster** |
| Cost of document review | $480,000 | $72,000 | **85% savings** |
| Contracts requiring human review | 2,400 | 847 | **65% reduction** |
| Key evidence documents found | Unknown | 3 critical contracts | **Case-changing** |
| Attorney hours | 4,800 | 1,200 | **75% reduction** |

### Case Outcome

The three "smoking gun" contracts LegalMind identified contained provisions that:

1. Explicitly capped liability at $2M (vs. $47M claimed)
2. Required written notice of breach (never provided)
3. Contained a mandatory arbitration clause (case dismissed from court)

**Result: Case settled for $1.8M—a 96% reduction from the original $47M claim.**

## Partner Testimonial

> *"LegalMind didn't just save us money—it won the case. The AI found three contracts in 2,400 that changed everything. Our associates would have found them eventually, but maybe not until month three. Having them in week one let us build our entire defense strategy around airtight contract language. The opposing counsel never saw it coming."*

## Associate Testimonial

> *"Instead of reading 2,400 contracts from cover to cover, I reviewed 847 flagged documents with the AI's analysis guiding me. I found the key evidence in contract #1,847—something I might have missed if I was exhausted from reading 1,846 documents manually. LegalMind kept me sharp for the work that mattered."*
