## Client Profile

## The Challenge

TechFlow Industries, a fast-growing enterprise software company, was struggling with contract management at scale. With sales teams closing deals across North America, Europe, and Asia, the legal department became a bottleneck.

### Pain Points

- **Inconsistent Reviews**: Different regional teams applied different standards
- **Approval Delays**: Sales deals stalled waiting for legal review (avg 8 days)
- **Risk Exposure**: Non-standard terms were slipping through in rush reviews
- **High Outside Counsel Costs**: Overflow work went to expensive law firms
- **No Visibility**: General Counsel had no insight into contract risk patterns

> *"We were hemorrhaging money on outside counsel, missing sales deadlines, and I had no way to know what risks were hiding in our contract portfolio. Something had to change."*
> 
> — **Jennifer Walsh**, General Counsel

## The Solution

TechFlow implemented **LegalMind Enterprise** with API integration into their existing CLM (Contract Lifecycle Management) system.

### Implementation Approach

| Phase | Timeline | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Phase 1 | Weeks 1-2 | API integration with Ironclad CLM |
| Phase 2 | Weeks 3-4 | Pilot with US commercial team |
| Phase 3 | Month 2 | Rollout to EMEA and APAC |
| Phase 4 | Month 3 | Full deployment + analytics dashboard |

### Workflow Integration

```
Sales uploads contract → CLM triggers LegalMind API → 
AI analysis in < 2 min → Risk score assigned → 
Low-risk: Auto-approved | High-risk: Routed to attorney
```
