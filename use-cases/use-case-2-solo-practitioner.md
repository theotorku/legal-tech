## Client Profile

| | |
|---|---|
| **Attorney** | Marcus Chen, Esq. |

## The Challenge

Marcus Chen left BigLaw three years ago to start his own practice serving startups and small businesses. His reputation for thorough contract review brought steady referrals—but success created a new problem.

### Pain Points

- **One-Person Bottleneck**: Every contract review depended entirely on Marcus
- **Weekend Work**: Routinely worked 60+ hour weeks just to keep up
- **Delayed Responses**: Clients waited 3-5 days for contract feedback
- **Growth Ceiling**: Had to decline new clients due to capacity limits
- **No Vacation**: Couldn't take time off without losing clients

> *"I left BigLaw for work-life balance, but I was working just as hard—with none of the support staff. I was turning away good clients because I physically couldn't review more contracts."*
